# Bigmart-Sales-Prediction
This repo will guide you through the basic analysis, EDA and the prediction in the Bigmart Sales Prediction challenge given by Analytics Vidhya.

# What the project is about?
The main objective of this project is to handle, explore, analyze some features of selected items and predict the sales of the each item on ten outlets of Bigmart. The problem statement is as follows and copied directly from Analytics Vidhya.
Bigmart is an indian supershop brand. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet from this dataset. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales

# What is the task?
The task is to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right item sales.  We were provided with some features of their items, including details like item category name, item price, and item visibility and also some features about the outlets.

# What action did I take?
To predict the sales, I had to tackle the problem following the standard data science pipelines. I cleaned the noisy data, analyze them, visualized the distribution when necessary, performed feature engineering, and cross validated the performance using a machine learning algorithm. The actions were well described and demonstrated in the codes.

# Codes
•	Bigmart_price.ipynb: The task of the code can be subdivided in following groups:
o	Wrangling the data
o	Perform basic descriptive analysis from the features
o	Provide necessary visualization for the sales distribution in many cases
o	Perform all necessary feature transformation to perform machine learning algorithms.
o	Applied Linear Regression in two forms.
o	Use r2 score and mean scored error to compare the performance

# Results and take-home information
From the analysis and result-comparison, I found that using all the features to predict performed better than using only four of them in case of Linear Regression. 

# What could be done in the future?
•	Applying other ML algorithms for better performance.
